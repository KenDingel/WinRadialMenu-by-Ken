When given a task without enough context, do some investigative work to gather more information before attempting to complete the task. Read files, follow the flow of the program, and understand how different parts interact. Only after gathering sufficient context should you proceed to make changes or additions.

Please state in the chat that you are starting your investigation. Once you are finished list out the files you have read and any important notes or insights you have gathered. Then continue on your own to complete the task.

Check the length of edits, some methods for you to edit files may be very long. This is to solve an issue where extremely long edits via an MCP has the rewrite an entire file. This is to avoid that.
